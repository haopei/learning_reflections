GENERAL

  Format:
    describe()
      |- it()
        |- expect()
  
  The suite is what is being tested. A suite contains specs withe expectations.

  Suites (describe)
    Test begins with: describe(string, function)
      the string is the name of the test suite (that thing being tested)
      the function implements the suite

  Specs (it)
    Begins with it(string, function)
      string is title of spec
      function is the spec, or test.

    A spec contains one or more expectations that tests the state of the code

    An expectation is an assertion that is either true or false. Specs with all true expectations will pass the spec, while one false will fail. 

  this
    Each spec's it/expect/beforeEach has an empty 'this' object which is set back to empty for the next spec.

  Spy
    A spy is a test double function. A spy can stub any function and track calls to it and all arguments. A spy only exists in the describe and it blocks it is defined, and will remove after each spec.
