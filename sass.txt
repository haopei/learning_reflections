GENERAL
	
	_partials.scss
		These are files which are to be imported into the main css file. Partials are named with a _leading_underscore.css which indicates to Sass that it is not to be created into its own css file.

	@import
		Import partials into your base.css with the @import <file_name> code. For example: Given base.sass and _reset.sass, import using:
			@import reset

	@mixin
		A mixin lets you make a group of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout the site. SCSS Mixing Example:

			@mixin border-radius($radius) {
				-webkit-border-radius: $radius;
				-moz-border-radius: $radius;
				-ms-border-radius: $radius;
				border-radius: $radius;
			}

			div { @include border-radius(10px); }

	@extend (or, inheritance)
		Takes an existing style, and extends it into another style. Example:

			.message { color: red; border: 2px solid red; }
			.success { @extend .message; font-size: 12px; }

	Operators
		Perform computations inside styles. Example:

			.container {width: 100%; }
			.left { width: 600 / 960 * 100%; }
			.right { width: 300 / 960 * 100%; }
