VECTOR VS RASTER
	Vector uses lines, points, polygons to represent an image, while raster represents an image by encoding the individual values of each pixel within a rectangular grid.

	Vectors deliver sharp results at every resolution and zoom settings. 

	Vectors are suitable for simple geometric shapes. Images like photography may be too complex for vectors. 

	Raster images better handle 'photo' images using formats like gif, jpeg, png, or the newer jpeg-xr and WebP. 

	Raster images cannot maintain quality when zoomed.


HIGH RES SCREENS
	High resolution screens have several pixels per css pixel. Image optimization is same regardless of screen res.

ONLY SHIP NECESSARY PIXELS
	Avoid shipping the size of an image which is larger in dimensions than what is required to be displayed on the browser.
