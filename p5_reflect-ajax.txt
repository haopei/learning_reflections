AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML

JARGON
	
	Callback Functions
		When a browser sends a request to the server and receives a response, callback functions take that response and does something with it. Callback functions are a set of instructions to be performed on the response received. 


GENERAL
	
	AJAX requests can be fired at any time (before or after page load). Response often involves html to be inserted into the page.

jQuery
	
	var $greeting = $('#greeting');
	The $variable name prefix is used to identify that it is a jquery object, and serves no functionality beyond that.
