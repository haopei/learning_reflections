GOOGLE MAPS API
===============

GENERAL

    There are base maps and styled maps.

    Satellites allow for hi-res imagery, and 45 degrees pics.

    Streets Map lets you browse through streets with 360 degrees panorama.

    Places add location context to your maps. 

    Routing: finding best routes from A to B.

    Data-visualisation brings life into google maps with animation. 

    The Lat value ranges between -90 and 90 inclusively. A lat value of -100 will be set to -90, and a value of 120 will be set to 90.

    Lng ranges between -180 and 180. Because longitudes wrap around the globe, a value of (-190) will be set to 170 and 190 will be set to -170.

    Geocoding: the process of converting street addresses to geographical coordinates.

    Each line of latitude (parallel lines), or each degree, separates about 69 miles of distance. There are 60 minutes in one degree. Latitudes are measured relative to the equator (0 degrees). Longitudes are not parallel, and all intersect at the north and south poles.

    Bounds represent the rectangle viewport of the map. It is defined by a North-East point and a South-West point which forms the rectangle together.

    Controls are widgets which are positioned absolute on top of the map, while overlays move with the underlying map.


Map object
    
    Create map object:
        var map = new google.maps.Map(div, options)
        For every map options, there is a 'set' and 'get' function. For example: map.getZoom(), map.setPosition()

Other Objects:
    
    LatLng: a point in geographical coordinates using lat/lng. You cannot modify the coordinates of a LatLng object. If you want to compute another point, you need to create a new one. 
    google.maps.LatLng(lat,lng)

    Markers
        Markers are constructed using the google.maps.Marker({options}). Markers are removed by setting its map option to null:

            var market = new google.maps.Marker({map: map});
            market.setMap(null);

        To handle multiple markers, contain them inside an array and call setMap() to each. You can remove all markers by setting this array length to 0;

    MapType 
        Holds information about the types of maps. Each MapType object holds methods that handle retrieval and release of times and properties that define its visual behaviour.

DRAWING USING OVERLAYS

    Overlays are objects added to the map to designate points, lines, areas or a collection of objects. Overlay objects are tied to longitude and latitude coordinates so they move when dragged or map is zoomed. Overlay types include: markers, info windows, polylines, polygons, circles/rectangles, symbols, ground overlays, custom overlays.

    Markers: indicate single location on a map. Customizable with custom image and colour. Works with Info Windows to provide contextual information.     

    Symbols are svgs which can be used to customize the images of markers or add images to polylines. See: Symbols.

    SHAPES

        Shapes are objects on a map tied to lat/lng coordinates. Shapes are available in: lines, polygons, circles, rectangles. 

        Polylines are used to draw lines which represent an ordered sequence of locations. 

        Polygons represent an area on a map using arbitrary shapes. Like polylines, polygons represent an ordered sequence of locations. Unlike polylines, polygons define a region that they enclose. 

    Ground Overlays: used to place an image on a map

Places
    
    Sign up for Places api key

    use <autocomplete_obj>.getPlace() to get details about the selected place

    With places, you can do these searches: nearby, text, radar, place details request. 

    Nearby search: must include a location via either LatLngBounds, or a circular area (latlng + radius)


GEOCODING API
    
    Geocoding is the process of converting an address string to a geographic coordinate. Reverse geocoding is the conversion of coordinates to human-readable address. Example:

        // returns json object
        https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA&key=API_KEY

    Google Geocoding API provides geocoding service over HTTP request. 

    Include geocode api key as 'key' parameter in request.

    Geocode API can only be used with Google Maps. Geocoding results without displaying them on map is prohibited.

    Geocode Request parameters include address or 'components' (required), bounds (for biased results), api key,language, region (region biasing using top level domain), components filter (return from specific area). Example of components:
        https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=santa+cruz&components=country:ES&key=AIzaSyB6tnYAqdRsoSx6iA5m7OV0cdtsGktBtD4

    Geocode request's response contains 'results', and 'status' root elements. Results contain address_components, formatted_address, geometry, and types. Status contains status code.

    Geocode geometry contains information about 'location' (lat/lng values)
