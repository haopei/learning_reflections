ABOUT
	Setting up a task building workflow environment using npm, gulp, bower, sass.

NPM (Package Manager)
	The node.js package manager used to download project dependencies into package.json.

	Used to download gulp dependencies inside the package.json

	Download and install using direct download on nodejs.org

	Node is used to run gulp

	The 'name' property inside the package.json becomes part of a URL, and an argument in the commandline, and a folder name. The name and version number form an identifier that is assumed to be unique. 

	Install all dependencies
		$ npm install


GULP (Task Runner) 

	Install gulp using npm
		$ npm install gulp -g

	Install a gulp plugin in project dir
		$ npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev //save as development dependency

	gulp.run()
		runs tasks with maximum concurrency


SASS 
	Install sass:
		gem install sass

BOWER (Frontend Library Package Manager)
	
	initialize bower.json for collaboration
		$ bower init

	Install all project dependencies from bower.json
		$ bower install 

	install a library
		$ bower install <library>#<version_number> [-s]
		[-s] saves to bower.json file
		Example: bower install jquery#1.9.2 -s

	Check bower list of installed libraries per project
		$ bower list [--path]


	When bower is asked to install a library with dependencies, it also installs the dependencies automatically. For example, installing backbone.js will also install its dependency, underscore.js. Uninstalling backbone will also remove underscore. 

GETTING STARTED
	
	Create project folder and subfolders

	Init git and add .gitignore file
		$ git init

	Create the package.json:
		$ npm init

	Install gulp
		$ npm install gulp --save-dev

	Install bower
		$ npm install bower -g

	Create gulpfile.js in root directory
		- require gulp and other plugin dependencies 
		- gulp runs default task
		- gulp.src() reads files
		- gulp.dest() writes files
